## [v0.3.2] - 2026-07-29

Add a chat output target for conversational LLM endpoints (#67)
Add a `chat` delivery type that POSTs to an OpenAI-compatible
`/v1/chat/completions` endpoint, carries the running conversation as context,
reads the reply back, and surfaces it — spoken via TTS, typed into the focused
window, copied to the clipboard, or discarded. This makes VoxCtrl a voice front
end for the same API Open WebUI talks to.
The existing targets could not do this: `http` discards the response body and
has nowhere for prior turns to accumulate, the OpenAI post-processing path is a
stateless filter whose output replaces the dictated text, and `pipe` +
`response_pipe` needs a bridge daemon that owns the history itself.
Conversations are keyed by target id and held outside the target, because
`OutputTargetRouter::reload` rebuilds every target when settings are saved.
Each carries its own lock so a slow model on one target cannot stall another.
A failed or empty completion rolls the unanswered turn back. A spoken reset
phrase clears the conversation hands-free.
Also fixes a pre-existing test-isolation race: `test_inject_target_success_and_failure`
and `test_clipboard_target_linux_cli` mutate the process-global `PATH` and
`WAYLAND_DISPLAY`, which made `test_clipboard_target_success` fail
intermittently on headless CI depending on thread interleaving.

## [v0.1.6] - 2026-05-31

fix: pass --bundles deb directly to tauri binary for Linux CUDA build
npm run tauri build -- --bundles deb sends --bundles to cargo (not tauri)
because everything after -- is treated as cargo args. Calling
node_modules/.bin/tauri build --bundles deb -- --features cuda
puts --bundles before the cargo separator so tauri sees it correctly.

## [v0.1.6] - 2026-05-30

fix: search workspace for bundle artifacts instead of hardcoded path
Tauri may place bundles under src-tauri/target or the workspace target
depending on CLI version and workspace config. Searching from the repo
root finds them either way. Also adds a diagnostic fallback on Windows
that lists all .exe/.msi files when the bundle directory search finds
nothing, making future failures easier to diagnose.

## [v0.1.6] - 2026-05-30

chore: bump version to 0.1.6
v0.1.4 and v0.1.5 tags existed at pre-fix commits; 0.1.6 ensures the
release build includes all Windows fixes (E0282 annotation, unused
import, correct bundle artifact path).

## [v0.1.6] - 2026-05-30

Fix correctly updated version number v0.1.3

---

## [v0.1.6] - 2026-05-30

Fix correctly updated version number v0.1.3

---

## [v0.1.5] - 2026-05-30

fix: annotate pos type to resolve E0282 on Windows
On Windows, the #[cfg(target_os = "linux")] blocks that use `pos` are
compiled out, leaving the compiler unable to infer the Option type.
Explicit annotation fixes the build without affecting Linux behaviour.
